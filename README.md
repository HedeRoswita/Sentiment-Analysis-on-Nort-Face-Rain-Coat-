# Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews for North Face Raincoat Jackets-

# 1. Objective:
   
    In this project, I leveraged web scraping techniques to collect data from Amazon.com, specifically focusing on customer reviews of the North Face raincoat jacket. Utilizing sentiment analysis, I delved into understanding the overall sentiments expressed by customers towards this product. 
By analyzing the sentiment polarity of the reviews, I gained valuable insights into how customers perceive the North Face raincoat jacket. Moreover, I developed a predictive model capable of estimating sentiment polarity for new customer reviews. 

# 2. Classification Modeling
   
    In this project, three classification models were employed for sentiment analysis: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Complement Naive Bayes. 
These models play a crucial role in continuously assessing customer sentiments, assisting decision-making regarding product enhancements and marketing strategies.
   
# 3. Model Evaluation

   The Logistic Regression model emerged as the most effective predictor for customer review data, boasting an impressive accuracy rate of 90%. Its robust performance underscores its reliability in discerning sentiment from the reviews. Leveraging this model enables the evaluation of sentiment in new customer reviews, empowering decision-makers to gauge public perception accurately and make informed strategic decisions.
